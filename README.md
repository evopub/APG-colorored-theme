# APG Colored Light Theme for The Archive

![apg-colored-theme-600](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f653a6c0-4dc4-4f5b-b768-524a9916613f)

This colorful theme helps to visualize the levels of information in the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) software [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) for Apple Mac. 

## Inspiration

This theme is inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) *Minimal* Theme with *Catppuccin* Color Scheme and *Colorful Headings* activated.

## Configuration

This theme does not define the general font (in these screenshots it is *Atkinson Hyperlegible Regular*), but the monospaced font is hardcoded: `"font": {"name": "Lucida sans Typewriter", "relativeSize": "87%"}`. Of course this can be modified. 

The selector `table` is not active in The Archive for the moment but this theme is ready!

Help: the complete list of selectors and how to use them is at: <https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/The-Archive-Themes/blob/master/Syntax.md>

## Installation 

1. Download the file: 
2. Place it in `/Users/[YOUR ACCOUNT]/Library/Application Support/TheArchive/Themes/`
3. Select it in the settings of The Archive (Tab: *Appearance*)
